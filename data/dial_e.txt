AND NEVER GIVE UP
$0101#player_vision
sigma?
$0303#nitori_ob
anyway beta
what are you doing here
in the presence of a sigma
$0101#player_vision
(This Nitori seems to be a little crazy)
(Maybe Remilia did something to her)
$0303#nitori_ob
What
are you too stunned by my sigma grindset
are you gazed my my superior figure 
being an alpha and all that
yk how it is
$0101#player_vision
im just confused 
like why where you screaming earlier
and what is that book in your little mech
$0303#nitori_ob
(OH NO)
(THATS MY LIMITED EDITION HOW TO BE A SIGMA 101 BOOK)
(I CANT LET HER KNOW ABOUT MY PLANS)
(WHAT DO I DO)
$0101#player_vision
...hello
$0303#nitori_ob
(SHIIIIT)
Sigma rule number 2.
dont waste your words on simpletons
$0101#player_vision
sig..ma?
whats that
$0303#nitori_ob
What the fuck
are you seriously this old
maybe i need to teach you a thing or two
$0101#player_vision
maybe i do
$0303#nitori_ob
you know what
i see potential in you
take this watch
its how you start you journey
into becoming a sigma
$0101#player_vision
I mean sure why not
$0303#nitori_ob
Also..
Take this book too
I dont need it anymore
Im already a graduated sigma
$0101#player_vision
No thanks 
that would be a little too heavy for me
(why is it also sticky)
$0303#nitori_ob
AND REMEMBER
WE ARE SIGMAS
NOT ALPHAS
DESTROY THOSE ALPHAS AT ALL Cost
$0101#player_vision
um.. ok
(i also have to ask Remilia whats an alpha and a sigma)
#end


#s06
$0404#NSenemy_0_08
Stop there!
only alphas can come past me
you seem to be lacking the alpha energy
$0101#player_vision
...not you to. Meiling

$0404#NSenemy_0_08
WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST SAY
$0101#player_vision

$0404#NSenemy_0_08
THEY GOT TO OUR SAKUYA
THESE SIGMAS ARE ANIMALS
EVIL I SAY
$0101#player_vision

$0404#NSenemy_0_08
im gonna have to disappoint Lady Remilia 
but sigmas must be stopped
by death
$0101#player_vision
i dont like the sound of that
$0404#NSenemy_0_08
them maybe you should have considered being an alpha instead
but talk is cheap
Its time to END YOU!

$0404#NSdestroy_0_08

$0101#player_vision
Even if my power is limited,* this much won't take me down.
$0505+1#mark00
Hehe, so far everything is as I expected.
But can you say the same thing once the real game starts?
$0101#player_vision
The real game...?
$0505+1#mark00
Yes...the real game.
Let me just tell you, but this was a demonstration.
You can find out more in the official version.
$0101#player_vision
The official version...
Well...if it's a game Lady Remilia prepared,* I didn't think this could be the whole thing.
$0505+1#mark00
It will take some time until the release,* but look forward to it.
Anyways, congratulations on clearing the demo version today.
I'll be waiting at the official version.* See you soon...

$0606#NSdestroy_0_12
Nitori?

$0101#player_vision
She says she was a Sigma
She had a book
it was like
"HOW TO BE A SIGMA 101"
something like that
$0606#NSdestroy_0_12
and i thought the world would be cured of those
abominations
who would let a sigma in this world
$0101#player_vision
idk i think Remilia is the only one that could bring people here
$0606#NSdestroy_0_12
Alright well *Ill leave

So you finally arived
To make an offical apperance to my podcast
$0101#player_vision
so this is what everyone has been so excited about
$0505#NSenemy_0_47
are you impressed
i have fans around Gensokyo
and soon
everyone will be an alpha
and we could have reigned suprime
$0101#player_vision
thats nice
$0505#NSenemy_0_47
However
streets are saying your a sigma
$0101#player_vision
Nitori has been trying to rope me into her shenanigans
however im still confused about this whole "sigma" buissness
$0505#NSenemy_0_47
I see your just a pawn
your just one skibidi in a rizzler world
trying to find an ohio baddie to call your own
$0101#player_vision
can you speak in english please
or at least tell me what those words mean
$0505#NSenemy_0_47
Sakuya 
this whole world is filled with brainrot
and you are the last one left
obivious to it all
$0101#player_vision
i do notice it Mistress
I just havent been using it
$0505#NSenemy_0_47
Sakuya
thats the fucking point
Ohio was created to use Brainrot
pardon my English
You have been refrencing boomer ass memes Sakuya
$0101#player_vision
huh-
$0505#NSenemy_0_47
"Ice cream so good"
THAT WAS IN AUGUST OF 2023
$0101#player_vision
oh wow thats awhile ago
$0505#NSenemy_0_47
refrencing old ass memes isnt the only crime you have committed
Ive seen your facebook
and its discusting
$0101#player_vision
oh yea that thing
Marisa told me to get one
she seemed really giggly about it to for some reason
$0505#NSenemy_0_47
THATS BECAUSE SHE WAS FUCKING WITH YOU
SHE WANTED TO SEE YOU REACT TO AI ART WITH
"God never makes mistakes" WITH THE PRAYING EMOJI AT THE END
$0101#player_vision
Ai art?
$0505#NSenemy_0_47
You BOOMERS ARE SO FUCKING STUPID 
YOU AND REIMU
YOU GUYS ARE YEARS BEHIND
which is why i made this world to catch you up to speed
(and make the podcast)
(mostly the podcast)
$0101#player_vision
okay?
so can i go now
$0505#NSenemy_0_47
no we are fighting
and we are listening to a podcast while we do so
$0101#player_vision

#end

#t36

#s37
$0505#NSdestroy_0_46

$0505#NSdestroy_0_46
silly
the podcast will never be gone
maybe this time ill include Flan in it
$0101#player_vision
that would be interesting
$0505#NSdestroy_0_46
hmmm but there is something strange i noticed
$0101#player_vision
what is it
$0505#NSdestroy_0_46
I should have been able to ban you from this world
since only i can invite people to the podcast
so sigmas dont invade it
but then how is Nitori here
$0101#player_vision
Nitori has been acting strange lately
she had this book
something about sigmas
$0505#NSdestroy_0_46
wait
did it kinda look like a ticket
$0101#player_vision
yea...
$0505#NSdestroy_0_46
was it also suprisingly sticky
$0101#player_vision
yea...
$0505#NSdestroy_0_46
no way...
its Flan
SHES BEEN CONTROLLING THE PODCAST
SHES A SPY
A SIGMA SPY
$0101#player_vision
now that edgemaxxing stuff seem a whole lot worse doesnt it
$0505#NSdestroy_0_46
SAKUYA

oh wait
i forgot to ask about the music
$0808+1#mark00
oh that
$0101#player_vision
huh..
$0808+1#mark00
i think its because the mod developer was too lazy *to find more songs for the background music 
so they copy pasted the same song mutiple times and act like thats the bit
$0101#player_vision
oh..
$0808+1#mark00
dw this next area is diffrent
$0101#player_vision

how long is awhile
$0808#nitori_stage04_ivent
like..
9 hours
$0101#player_vision
oh
$0808#nitori_stage04_ivent
so i decided to take over her podcast
so the alphas will be clueless
and fall victim to the sigmas
you could have been my second in command
ruler of the alphas
but you sided with them
$0101#player_vision
well im not really a fan of what sigmas do
like edgemaxxing
$0808#nitori_stage04_ivent
you dug your own grave Sakuna
NOW LIE IN IT
$0101#player_vision

$0808#NSenemy_0_70
Im depraved of my gems to edgemax to
I guess i have to resort to my emergency supply
$0101#player_vision
im gonna have to get rid of your emergency supply when we get back
#end

#t49
$0808#NSenemy_0_70
SEE SAKUYA 
THIS IS THE POWER OF A TRUE SIGMA
ONE NOT BOUND BY LIMITS THE ALPHAS HAVE SET
#end

#t50
$0808#NSenemy_0_70
ALRIGHT ITS TIME TO GET SERIOUS
LETS BURN THIS PLACE TO THE GROUND
$0101#player_vision
does insurance cover this?
$0808#NSenemy_0_70
let the music set the scene
#end

#t51
$0808#NSdestroy_0_70
FUCK WHY ARE YOU SO OVERPOWERED
$0101#player_vision

and also the shrine stuff
$1010#NSenemy_0_0a
have you been trying to catch up with this new slang
$0101#player_vision
yea
its been hard for me
they constantly update them all the time
$1010#NSenemy_0_0a
yea i have to rely on Marisa to tell me this stuff
and sometimes she just comes in one day
talking about this hawk tuah podcast
$0101#player_vision
oh Cirno has been listening to that too
kinda weird for like an 8 year old to be listening to that
$1010#NSenemy_0_0a
wait hold on
how about when we fight we could play some music those kids listen to
so we get like assumulated or something
$0101#player_vision
sounds good to me

$0101#player_vision
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

shes learning to be like you youngins
$0101#player_vision
yea 
i wanna know what you guys are saying at least
$0303#nitori_stage05_ivent
i could see the aura rapidly decrease
you fell off Sakuya
$0808#fran_stage05_ivent
definitely
no Alpha could mistake you for anything less of a sigma
$0505#remi_stage05_ivent
you got some work to do Sakuya
playing requires you to put in the effort
$1010#NSdestroy_0_1a
also
you guys cant play here anymore
its fucking with the real world
wrap it up
$0808#fran_stage05_ivent
awww
but i liked playing here
$0505#remi_stage05_ivent
we probably should wrap up the podcast
weve already created 150 episodes
$0101#player_vision
you guys are fast
$0505#remi_stage05_ivent
Flan. We need to start working on season 2
where we branch off to Yoai too
$0808#fran_stage05_ivent
hmm good idea
$1010#NSdestroy_0_1a
why are you guys talking about yoai
$0303#nitori_stage05_ivent
hopefully the gooners will resist edging your podcast
$0808#fran_stage05_ivent
Sigma rule number 3.
If theres a podcast
there will be edgemaxxers

#s69
$0101#player_vision

$0101#player_vision
Oh, that makes sense
$0303#nitori_stage06_ivent
anyway i call this
the goon shed
$0101#player_vision
i dont like the sound of that
$0303#nitori_stage06_ivent
Its not that bad
you just fight people
no actual edging required
but you could if you want
$0101#player_vision
Ill just do the fighting
$0303#nitori_stage06_ivent
ok well have fun
...
oh btw
if your seeing this then you probably seen most if not all the dialouge
and the changed music
so like

you can go home now
